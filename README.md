# Neural-Networks

This is a example of neural networks plus genetic algorithms, 

i followed this tutorial in c++ http://www.ai-junkie.com/ (this site is awesome)

my code is in C# with Unity3D as interface (All code is in Portuguese!)

there are tanks that have to find and collect the green point scattered about a simple 2D world, 

there is four inputs, two of them represent a vector pointing to the closest green point 

and the other two represent the direction the tank is pointing. 

These four inputs give the tank's brain - its neural network

 everything it needs to know to figure out how to orient itself towards the green points 

(tanks can control how to rotate) aand after 50 generations they can find the green points very fast.
