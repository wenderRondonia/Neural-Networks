	@mainpage Gamelogic Extensions for Unity API Documentation

	This extension library contains a few light-weight utility classes and
	convenient extension methods for some Unity classes.

	@version 1.0

	(Note, this library also comes with other %Gamelogic Unity plugins).

	The library contains:
		- A base class for creating Singletons from any MonoBehaviour. See @ref Singleton<T>.
		- A light-weight state machine class. See @ref StateMachine<TLabel>.
		- A monobahviour class that defines generic methods for Instantiation. 
			See @ref GLMonoBehaviour.
		- A PlayerPrefs alternative that, in addition to the methods of the standard 
			PlayerPrefs, also defines methods for dealing with boolean types, and rays 
			of int, float, string and bool. See @ref GLPlayerPrefs.
		- Extensions for transform that allows easy setting of components of position, 
			scale and rotation separately. See @ref TransformExtensions.
		- Extensions for vectors to calculate the projection and rejection, and the 
			vector perpendicular (2D). See @ref VectorExtensions.
		- Extensions for Colors to get lighter or darker colors, get a color with 
			a given value, and get an opaque version of a given color. See @ref ColorExtensions.
